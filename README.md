Simple Storage Editor for Firefox Addons 
========================================

What does it do?
----------------
The addon lists currently installed addons that use [Addon SDK simple storage]
(https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/modules/sdk/simple-storage.html)
and allows the user to edit the contents of the storage.


Why?
----
Because Firefox allows a convinince method of editing preferences through about:config, but 
there is nothing to edit simple storage created by addons. This is especially convinient for 
mobile device testing and development.
